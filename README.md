This is a fun project with the goal of setting up a chess engine.

The concept works as follows:

1. Initial setup of HTML and CSS for a chess board
2. Set up bitwise representation of a chess position
3. Visualize bitwise represenation on the chess board
4. Define legal moves for every piece
5. Create an evaluation function to score a position
6. Set up a tree structure within which the engine can find good moves
7. Expand visualisation so that one can play against the chess engine
